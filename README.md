# Zindi Competitions Repository

Welcome to my **Zindi Competitions Repository**! This repository is a collection of all the code, notebooks, and resources I've used to participate in various competitions hosted on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/). Whether you're here to learn, collaborate, or just explore, I hope you find something useful!

[Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) is a platform for data science competitions in Africa, focused on solving real-world problems across various domains such as agriculture, healthcare, finance, and more. By participating in these competitions, I aim to contribute to impactful solutions while improving my data science skills.

# Repository Structure

This repository is organized by competition, with each competition having its own folder. Each folder contains:

- **Code**: Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or other relevant code files.
- **Data**: (Optional) If the dataset is small enough, it may be included here. Otherwise, links to the original datasets on Zindi are provided.
- **README.md**: A brief description of the competition, my approach, and results.
- **Resources**: Any additional resources, such as documentation, papers, or tutorials, that helped me during the competition.
